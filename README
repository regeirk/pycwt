Continuous wavelet transform module for Python. Includes a collection
of routines for wavelet transform and statistical analysis via FFT
algorithm. This module references to the numpy, scipy and pylab Python
packages.

The sample script (sample.py) illustrates the use of the wavelet and
inverse wavelet transforms and the results are plotted in a figure
similar to the sample_nino3.png image file.

DISCLAIMER
    This module is based on routines and data provided by C. Torrence
    and G. Compo available at http://paos.colorado.edu/research/wavelets/
    and on routines provided by A. Brazhe available at

INSTALLATION
    Copy all the contents into a location included in the Python search
    path. On Linux distribution one such option is

        ~/.local/lib/python2.x/site-packages/kPyWavelet
